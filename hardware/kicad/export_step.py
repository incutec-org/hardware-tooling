export_step.py — standardized STEP exports for KiCad boards.

kicad-cli's default STEP export writes only the board body and the component 3D
models: no copper, no pads, no silkscreen. Imported into Fusion that is a bare
green slab with parts on it. This script drives kicad-cli with a fixed flag set
so every generated STEP uses the same representation and lands in the same
predictable location:

    <repo root>/export/<ProductName>.step

In batch mode output is rooted at each discovered repository rather than beside
the `.kicad_pcb`, because board files may live at different directory depths.

THE STANDARD EXPORT IS: board body + components + pads + silkscreen, plus
copper that a mask opening leaves bare. Each decision below is measured:

  Soldermask is EXCLUDED. kicad-cli models no mask apertures: exporting F.Mask +
  B.Mask for a whole board adds only 2-3 ADVANCED_FACEs over a body-only export,
  i.e. flat sheets with no openings cut. Including it buries every pad under an
  unbroken slab. It also carries a 17% transparency factor (silkscreen 10%),
  which made earlier exports look like frosted glass.

  Mask GRAPHICS are recovered instead. Logos and lettering drawn on F.Mask or
  B.Mask are openings that expose bare copper on the real board. Since kicad-cli
  emits no apertures, the exposed regions are synthesised: a mask layer rendered
  to polygons IS the openings, a copper layer rendered to polygons is the copper,
  and the intersection is the bare metal. See add_mask_exposed_copper.

  Tracks and zones are EXCLUDED for FILE SIZE, not visibility. The mask is
  excluded here, so that copper would sit about 35 um proud of the board and
  would be plainly visible, exactly as the pads are.

  Everything past Edge.Cuts is CUT (--clip, on by default), in two passes:
    1. A drill that straddles the outline is a castellation. The hole is
       subtracted FROM the outline so the board body carries the notch, as the
       KiCad 3D viewer draws it, and only then is the drill zeroed so no barrel
       is left floating. Zeroing the drill without notching loses the notch;
       setting the pad to SMD as well collapses it to one copper layer and loses
       all the back-side copper.
    2. Any pad with copper outside is REBUILT, not reshaped: intersect with the
       outline, delete, and add fresh SMD pads, one per copper side. Reshaping in
       place fails silently when the pad is already PAD_SHAPE_CUSTOM or its
       padstack is front/inner/back.

  Silkscreen is NOT clipped and can overhang. Component 3D models are NOT
  clipped: that needs a CAD kernel, which is not available here.

Transparency is zeroed in the written STEP, the export timestamp is normalised,
and product names are rewritten to the product. The file is still not
byte-reproducible: kicad-cli emits STYLED_ITEM records in a nondeterministic
order, and rebuilt pads carry random UUIDs that perturb coordinates by ~0.3 um.

--preset exists only as an escape hatch for copper inspection work, and its
output does not belong in a repo:
  full   standard + tracks + zones (outer layers)
  inner  full + inner copper layers
  body   board body + components only (kicad-cli's bare default)

Clipping needs pcbnew, so run with KiCad's bundled Python, same as
render_board.py. Without it the export still runs, unclipped, with a warning:

  KPY=/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3
  $KPY hardware/kicad/export_step.py --all --root path/to/hardware

KiCad may stay open: every board edit happens on a temp copy.

`--products` drops fabrication panels and bench fixtures from a batch; those
projects export correctly but are not product-level fit-check models.

Usage:
  export_step.py --all --root path/to/hardware
  export_step.py --all --root path/to/hardware --repo board-repo
  export_step.py --all --root path/to/hardware --products
  export_step.py <board.kicad_pcb> -o out.step
