check_models.py — verify every board's 3D models before an export or a fab release.

kicad-cli treats an unresolvable 3D model as a warning and still exits 0, so a
board that has lost half its components exports "successfully" as a bare slab.
This turns that into a hard failure, and it runs BEFORE the export rather than
reporting it afterwards.

Five checks per footprint, per board:

  E1  library nickname resolves in neither the project nor the global
      fp-lib-table, so the footprint cannot be loaded at all
  E2  nickname resolves but the footprint is not in that library any more
  E3  a referenced model file does not exist on disk
  E4  the library footprint has models but the board instance has none
  E5  board and library disagree about the model list (path, offset, scale,
      rotation or visibility)

E5 is the one that matters for propagation: those are exactly the footprints a
library-only fix cannot reach, because a .kicad_pcb embeds its own copy of every
footprint including the model paths.

Only the FIRST applicable error is reported per footprint, so a footprint that is
missing from its library (E2) is not also counted as drift (E5). That makes the
E5 column smaller than a full drift audit would show, and more actionable: fix
E1/E2 first, then re-run and the remaining drift appears.

Needs pcbnew, so run with KiCad's bundled Python:

  KPY=/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3
  $KPY check_models.py --all
  $KPY check_models.py <board.kicad_pcb> -v

Exits non-zero if anything is found, or with --blocking-only, only when E3/E4 is
found. That distinction matters because E1, E2 and E5 do not affect the exported
STEP at all: a .kicad_pcb carries its own copy of every footprint, models
included, and that copy is what kicad-cli exports. Gating a release build on the
full set would block on cosmetic library drift.

Read-only: no board or library is written.
